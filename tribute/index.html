                        Elon Reeve Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded
                        PayPal in 1999 SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a
                        multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of
                        Compaq Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would
                        send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his
                        portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016, and cemented his standing as a leader of
                        industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's
                        administration.

                                    Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa, the son
                                    of Maye Musk, a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan,
                                    Canada, and Errol Musk, a South African

                                    , pilot, and
                                    sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal and a younger sister, Tosca. His paternal
                                    grandmother was British, and he also has
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                                        Dutch</a> ancestry. His maternal grandfather Joshua Haldeman was American, from
                                    Minnesota. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his
                                    father in the suburbs of Pretoria, which Musk chose two years after his parents
                                    split up, but now says was a mistake. As an adult, Musk has severed relations
                                    with his father. He has a half-sister and a half-brother.

                                <p> During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader At age 10, he developed an
                                    interest in computing and he taught himself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming"

                                        Programming</a> at the age of 10, and by the age of 12 sold the code of a
                                    BASIC-based
                                    video game he created called Blastar, to a magazine called PC and Office
                                    Technology, for approximately $500. A web version of the game is available
                                    online. His childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series
                                    from which he drew the lesson that "you should try to take the set of actions that
                                    are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and
                                    reduce the length of a dark age if there is one.

                                    before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted
                                    that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United
                                    States. As he states, "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great
                                    things are possible, more than any other country in the world. Knowing it
                                    would be easy to get to the United States from Canada, he moved to Canada against
                                    his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th birthday,after
                                    obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.</p>
